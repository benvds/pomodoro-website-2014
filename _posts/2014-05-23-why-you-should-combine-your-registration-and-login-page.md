During an optimization round last week we came upon a point of improvement; combining the default registration and login page. This is often overlooked by web applications because a lot of _frameworks and libraries implement this functionality on separate pages by default_.

Use cases for combining registration and signing in come up when you have both a public and a restricted part of your product, like on a webshop. When a anonymous visitor gets to restricted content or functionality he is usually redirected to the login page.

For registered users _you just want to get out of the way and let them continue with their task_. For new users you'll want  do some _final persuasion of your product and make registration as frictionless as possible_.

But _you don't know if an anonymous visitor is a registered user or a new user and both have very different use cases_. This is why you should **combine the default registration and login page**. This page should **focus on registration** because you don't want to loose new users. You can always communicate directly once you've got someone's contact info in case something has gone wrong.

Eventually you'll want multiple landing / registration pages serving different campaigns and target groups. Public pages serve mainly marketing purposes like customer persuasion and search engine visibility but also allow you to _split up target groups_. With this you can _direct them to optimized registration pages_.

                <p>This is something I hear a lot from people developing online services. The right customer experience is key if you want to <em>improve customer&nbsp;value and grow your business</em>.</p>

                <p>
                    A lot of projects miss deadlines, go over budget and badly communicate value to their customers. <strong>Unforeseen complications, unclear communication and wrong expectations result in bad decisions which have a snowball effect during the rest of the project</strong>. Your team and customers feel frustrated and you don't have the control you'd like to have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When your project finally goes live it doesn't have the response you hoped for. Did you lose momentum? Could cost have been lower? Could conversions have been higher? Could users have been happier?
                </p>

                <p>
                    For an effective approach and better results you'll need to be able to answer:
                </p>
                <ul class="challenges">
                    <li>how to communicate value and persuade customers online?</li>
                    <li>do customers actually pay for what they say they want?</li>
                    <li>what existing possibilities and opportunities are you missing?</li>
                    <li>why do you miss deadlines and go over budget?</li>
                    <li><strong>what are the most effective content and features?</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    To make all this easier, you need to spend a lot of time learning about various fields. You'll need to constantly stay up-to-date with with the latest possibilities, tools and solutions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>Even if all the individual parts work well and you have experts available, a lot is lost in translation</em>, especially information coming from developers. Having a lack of context or understanding hurts the overall project. This makes getting the right expectations and balancing things out very hard.
                </p>

                    Wouldn't it be nice to feel more empowered and avoid these risks by?
                </p>

                <ul class="usps">
                    <li>reducing the communication gap between disciplines</li>
                    <li>having manageable insights &amp; expectations</li>

                    <li><strong>not wasting time on content and features with little impact</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Development will be much easier to manage when everybody involved has a solid understanding of the bigger picture. This allows for clearer communication, better expectations and higher morale. You'll have <strong>more insight and control allowing for a smoother development process, happier customers and better results</strong> from your product.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Do you like to know what a <em>results focused customer experience</em> and a more effective development process can do for you?

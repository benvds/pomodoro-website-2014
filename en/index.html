        <h2>1. attract new customers</h2>
        <p>
            The most effective way to attract customers is by providing value first. For example, using a personality questionnaire for job seekers or a matching site for parents and babysitters.
        </p>

        <h2>2. user experience improvements</h2>
        <p>
            Improving the user experience means finding the balance between communication, usability and technical capabilities. To increase customer lifetime value for example.
        </p>

        <h2>3. results-oriented product development</h2>
        <p>
            A results-oriented product development requires context, understanding and the right expectations for all involved disciplines. Establishing clear rules between business and IT makes communication clearer, management easier and allows for more productive development.

<q class="customer-pain">
    Our biggest issue was that we wasted too much time on features that didn't deliver the results we had been counting on.
</q>

<p>
    This is something I hear a lot from people who develop online services. The right customer experience is essential if you want to increase customer value and expand your online business.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Many development projects miss their deadlines, exceed their budget and underperform in the communication of added value.</strong> Unexpected complications, unclear communication and unrealistic expectations lead to bad decisions. Above all, they have a snowball effect for the rest of the project. Result: your team and your customers become frustrated and you have less grip on matters than you might like.
</p>

<p>
    When your project finally goes live, it does not meet the expectations that you had initially hoped for. Have you lost your momentum? Could the cost have been kept lower? Could the conversion have been greater and could we have made the customer happier?
</p>

<p>
    For an effective approach with better results you'll need to be able to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul class="challenges">
    <li>how to communicate value and persuade customers online?</li>
    <li>do visitors actually pay for what they say they want?</li>
    <li>which opportunities and possibilities already exist?</li>
    <li>why do you miss your deadlines and exceed your budget?</li>
    <li><strong>which content and features are the most effective?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    To be able to answer these questions, you need a lot of knowledge of various fields. You will need to remain constantly up-to-speed on the latest developments, possibilities and solutions.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Even if all the individual parts work well and you have experts available, a lot is lost in translation</strong>, especially information coming from developers. Through a lack of understanding and context it is difficult to satisfy expectations and balance disciplines. As a result, the whole project suffers.
</p>

<p>
    What would it be like to feel more empowered and avoid these risks through?
</p>

<ul class="usps">
    <li>reducing breaches between disciplines</li>
    <li>acquiring manageable insights and expectations</li>
    <li>more control over budget and deadlines</li>
    <li>more insight into the current possibilities and opportunities</li>
    <li>a systematic approach to online growth</li>
    <li><strong>not wasting time on low impact content and features</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    Development is far easier to manage when all those involved have a thorough understanding of the bigger picture. This ensures that communication and expectations are clear and that morale is higher. Delivering you more insight and control, a <strong>smoother development process, resulting in happier users and better product results</strong>.
